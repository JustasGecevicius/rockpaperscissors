## Description

This was the first project that I built mainly with Javascript and bundled with webpack. It has 3 section that are generated with JavaScript every time the user clicks on it. All the information about sections or products is stored in seperate objects or arrays.  

## Technologies used

### `HTML/CSS/JavaScript`

The HTML provides only the skeleton for this website everything else is built by Javascript and styled by CSS. It relied heavily on custom modules and components to make the website responsive. Each time a new navigation button was pressed using Javascript I wiped all the information from the main div, created the new elements for it and then attached it to the main div.

### `webpack`

webpack was used to bundle all the different modules and pages into one when it came time to deploy the website and make the development process easier.

## Final Remarks

This project taught me a lot how to split the code into different reusable modules and components which will later help me immensely when I am learning React. It also taught me how to efficiently create and delete elements from the DOM.
